<BODY>
<H1>Welcome to the JXTA Protocol Specification Project!</H1>

<H2>Goals</H2>
<P>This project is responsibile for the formal specification and documention of 
the JXTA Protocols. Compliant JXTA implementations must conform the schemas,
specifications and behaviours that the specification describes. There are 
several compatibile and interoperable implementations of the JXTA Protocols
available. </P>

<H2>Activities</H2>
<P>The JXTA Protocol Specification Project is focused upon the following tasks:</P>
<ul>
    <li>Developing formal, normative schemas for all of the XML structures used by
    the JXTA Protocol.</li>
    <li>Developing formal specifications and descriptions of the behaviour of
    the JXTA Protocols as well as the overall architecture of JXTA.</li>
    <li>Work with the JXTA user and implemntor communities as well as the 
    IETF/IRTF and other specification communities on the development and 
    specification of the JXTA protocols.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Status</H2>
<P>The JXTA Specification was submitted to the IETF June of 2002 in anticpation 
of forming a working group. The IETF declined to start a working group for JXTA,
but instead referred JXTA to their sister organization IRTF. The JXTA project 
participates with the IRTF's Peer-to-Peer working group, but we have also  
independantly continued to advance the JXTA specification.</P>

<P>The overall JXTA Project, as well as this specification sub-project,
continues to enhance, evolve and extend the JXTA Protocol Specification. We 
remain interested in working with standards bodies on formal approval, but for 
thecurrent time our focus is working with the JXTA user and implementor 
communities to extend JXTA to meet their needs.</P>
</P>

<H2>JXTA Protocol Specifications</H2>
<P>These are the specification documents and schemas which the JXTA 
Specification Project has produced. They are updated on a roughly
quarterly/bi-yearly basis.</P>

<H2>JXTA Protocol Specifications Project Files</H2>

<P>The JXTA Specification is prepared using the 
<A href="http://www.docbook.org/" target="_blank">DocBook</A> XML Stylesheet.
This allows us to create HTML, PDF, plain text and other output formats from the
same source document. DocBook also has special features for technical
documentation. You can view the in-progress work on the 
specifications in DocBook source form from the source repository at : <A HREF="https://jxta-spec.dev.java.net/source/browse/jxta-spec/src/">JXTA Specification Source</A></P>
