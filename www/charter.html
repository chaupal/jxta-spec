    <p>
      The JXTA Specification Project's primary goal is to ensure the standardization
      of the JXTA Core Protocols.  The JXTA Core Protocols are currently defined by
      a combination of the "JXTA 1.0 Protocol Specification" and the source code of
      the Java implementation.  In addition, the JXTA Community has discussed a very
      wide range of applications and services that would be desireable to have 
      implemented on JXTA.  It is expected that significant changes to the JXTA Core
      protocols may take place as the standardization process unfolds.
    <p>
      The JXTA Specification Project will be responsible for:
    <ul>

      <li>Maintaining the glossary of terminology used within JXTA 
	(eg, Peers, Peer Groups, Services, Transports, ...);</li>

      <li>Defining the the relationship of core protocols to services,
	applications and bindings.</li>
	
      <li>Defining core protocols (eg., Discovery,  Routing, Information, Membership, ...); </li>

      <li>Defining message formats; defining name spaces; </li>

      <li>Determining the role of security with regards to core protocols, services 
	and applications; and </li>

      <li>Managing the definitions of transport bindings.</li>

      <li>Determining methods for verifying compatibility of JXTA implementations</li>

      <li>Defining algorithms for protocol implementation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The JXTA Specification Project will not be responsible for:
    <ul>
      <li>Mascots</li>

      <li>Language specific APIs (ie, Java JXTA API, C JXTA API, ...)</li>

      <li>Implementations of JXTA in any language</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Should the JXTA Specification Project be responsible for?
  
    <ul>
      <li>Protocol specifications for non-core services</li>

      <li>Protocol specifications for non-core application</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The JXTA Specification Project will manage all phases of the standardization 
      process (unordered):
      
    <ul>
      <li>Documenting the existing protocols as used in current implementations</li>

      <li>Collecting a requirements list from the Community</li>

      <li>Determining which requirements will be met in the Core Protocols;
	which should be handled as JXTA Services; and which will be considered
	out of scope</li>
	
      <li>Researching existing technologies which can be used to meet the
	requirements list without re-inventing the wheel</li>

      <li>Coordinate submission of the JXTA specification to the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</a>. </li>

      <li>Publish Internet-Drafts describing the JXTA Core Protocols, the
	JXTA Network Architecture	and Transport Bindings</li>
	
      <li>Assist in the development of test suites to ensure compliance of 
	implementations with the JXTA protocol specifications.</li>
	
      <li>Assist in the development of JXTA monitoring tools such as protocol
	filters for Ethereal, tcpdump, or other network monitors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
