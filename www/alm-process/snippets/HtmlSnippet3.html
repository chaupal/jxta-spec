<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />The JXTA Specification is prepared using the  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a> XML Stylesheet. This allows us to create HTML, PDF, plain text and other output formats from the same source document. DocBook also has special features for technical documentation. You can view the in-progress work on the  specifications in DocBook source form from the source repository at : <a href="https://jxta-spec.dev.java.net/source/browse/jxta-spec/src/">JXTA Specification Source</a>
