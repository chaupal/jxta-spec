The IETF declined assign JXTA to a working group, but instead referred JXTA to their sister organization IRTF. The JXTA project  participates with the IRTF's Peer-to-Peer working group, but we have also   independently continued to advance the JXTA specification.     <p>The overall JXTA Project, as well as this specification sub-project, continues to enhance, evolve and extend the JXTA Protocol Specification. We  remain interested in working with standards bodies on formal approval, but for  the current time our focus is working with the JXTA user and implementor  communities to extend JXTA to meet their needs.</p>
