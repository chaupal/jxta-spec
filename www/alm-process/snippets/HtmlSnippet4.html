<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />The JXTA Specification was submitted to the IETF June of 2002 in anticpation  of forming a working group. The IETF declined to start a working group for JXTA, but instead referred JXTA to their sister organization IRTF. The JXTA project  participates with the IRTF's Peer-to-Peer working group, but we have also   independantly continued to advance the JXTA specification.     <p>The overall JXTA Project, as well as this specification sub-project, continues to enhance, evolve and extend the JXTA Protocol Specification. We  remain interested in working with standards bodies on formal approval, but for  the current time our focus is working with the JXTA user and implementor  communities to extend JXTA to meet their needs.</p>
