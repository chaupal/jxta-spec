<para>In order to deliver complete JXTA implementations, the developers of the
various JXTA Reference Bindings have produced a number of components 
which implement parts of the JXTA specification, but are either not required by 
the core specification or not specified. This section describes some of these 
components. These implementations may not be present in all JXTA Bindings and
Binding developers are not required to support them.</para>
