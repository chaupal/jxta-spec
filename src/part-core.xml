  <para>JXTA is designed to be a small system with only a few required 
  components and behaviours. The functionality that is required of all
  implementations is defined by the <firstterm linkend="gloss-jcs">JXTA Core 
  Specification</firstterm> and is documented in this section. Implementations 
  that wish to be JXTA compliant <phrase role="rfc2119">must</phrase> implement 
  all of the <xref linkend="core" endterm="core-title"/>.</para>
  
  <para>Implementation of the <xref linkend="core" endterm="core-title"/> does 
  not guarantee or even necessarily provide interoperability with other JXTA 
  implementations. There are a number of types of components and behaviours
  which need to be provided by JXTA implementation which are not part of the 
  <xref linkend="core" endterm="core-title"/>. Existing implementations of these 
  components are described separately in 
  <xref linkend="stdsvc" endterm="stdsvc-title"/> and 
  <xref linkend="refimpls" endterm="refimpls-title"/>. In order for a JXTA
  implementation to be interoperable with other implementations it may be
  necessary to implement some of the components described there.</para>
