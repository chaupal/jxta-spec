        How To Update the JXTA Spec Project Web Pages

    <H2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Introduction</FONT></H2>

    <P>This document describes the process you should follow in order
      to update the JXTA Protocols Specifications Document.  The spec document
      is maintained as a series of .xml documents in DocBook format.  There is
      a seperate file for each section of the specifications document which are
      then combined by a seperate document.

    <P>The subset of DocBook tags used in the .xml files is somewhat minimal, making
      it fairly easy to pick up the neccesary syntax by just reviewing the
      current .xml files themselves.  Tables are a bit tricky, but otherwise the
      the structure is straightforward.

    <P>The .xml files are transformed into an HTML document using docbook-xsl 
      stylesheets and an xslt processor.  The stylesheets and processor are not
      included in the CVS repository but can be easily found on the web 
      (see <A href="#references">References</A> below).  You must install the
      docbook-xsl package in order to generate/build and html document.

    <OL>
      <LI> CVS checkout the spec\www\v1.0\docboook module
      <LI> create a symbolic link <tt>docbook-xsl</tt> in the docbook subdirectory pointing
           to your local installation of the docbook-xsl files (ex: 
           <tt>ln -s ~/packages/docbook-xsl-1.60.1 docbook-xsl</tt>)
      <LI>Make your changes to the corresponding <b><i>section-name.xml</i></b> files.

      <LI>If you are adding or deleting a new section of the overall document, update
	the <b><i>book-JXTAProtocols.xml</i></b> file.

      <LI>When you are ready to publish a new spec revision, update the 
	<b><i>book-JXTAProtocols-revhistory.xml</i></b> file with the new version information.

      <LI> Run the following command from the spec\www\v1.0\docbook directory:
	<br><tt>xsltproc single-html.xsl book-JXTAProtocols.xml > JXTAProtocols.html</tt>
        <br><i>or</i>
   	<br><tt>java -cp xalan.jar;xerces.jar;xml-apis.jar org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -IN book-JXTAProtocols.xml -XSL single-html.xsl -OUT JXTAProtocols.html</tt>

      <LI>If the processing generates errors, more than likely you have created some
	markup that is not compliant with the DocBook dtd.  Check you changes.  Try
	to do a validation on the book-JXTAProtocols.xml file to spot errors.

      <LI>Use CVS to commit your changes
	
      <LI>You're done!

    <UL>
      <LI>The above steps assume you are using <tt>xsltproc</tt> to build the .html 
	document.  Other xslt engines should be able to do the transform as well.
	My experience with <tt>xalan</tt> generated an html file with
	very few CRLFs in the resulting document. <tt>xsltproc</tt> was also
	significantly faster.
      <LI>The <b><i>single-html.xsl</i></b> stylesheet above assumes you have 
	installed the docbook-xsl package at the same directory level as
	the .xml files.  If you have installed the package elsewhere, either :
                <ul>
                <li>Make a temporary change to the single-html.xsl file to reflect 
                the location.</li>
                <li>Create a directory link to the actual location.</li>
                <li>Specify the location of the docbook-xsl via an XML Catalog
                to your XSLT processor.</li></UL>
      <LI>The build process will run significantly faster if the <tt>--nonet</tt>
	option is added to the xsltproc command line.  However, the resulting
	document will have problems with the internal footnote references and
	is not suitable for publishing.  While very good for local testing, the
	resulting html document should not be commited back to the CVS tree.
      <LI>An alternative to the previous --nonet option is to bring the docbook
	dtd files local and change the http reference in sections-combined.xsl
	to reflect the local path.
      <LI>The <b><i>single-html.xsl</i></b> generates a single large html file.  Work
	is ongoing to generate a series separately linked html files.
      <LI>The &lt;calloutlist&gt; tags present particularly in the section-protocols.xml
	file are being used to annotate the spec document with differences against the
	reference implementation.  The single-html.xsl file removes these annotations,
	however they can be included by instead processing the single-html-callouts.xsl
	file.
